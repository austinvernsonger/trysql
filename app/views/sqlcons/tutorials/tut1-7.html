Isn't that cool?! If we're feeling sharp and lazy, we can use a shorthand ordering method.  
<br /><code>select * from courses order by 2</code><br /> 
Note: This does not mean column 2 of the actual table, but instead means column 2 of whatever query you specify. The default order by ranks values in ascending order.  If you want to rank highest-lowest, add the desc option like so  
<br /><code>select * from courses order by 2 desc</code><br />
