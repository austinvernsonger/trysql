<h3>Ch2-2: The Join (cont.)</h3>
<p>
We can also join multiple tables at a time, by adding another join clause.  Since we are using a "dimensional" model for our database, course_fcts essentially links all the other tables together.  Lets say we want to see students associated with their courses information.  
<br / ><code>select fname, lname, title from course_fcts a join students b on (a.student_id = b.id) join courses c on (c.id = a.course_id)</code>
