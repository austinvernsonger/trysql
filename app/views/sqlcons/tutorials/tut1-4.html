<h3> Ch1-4: Where like </h3>
<p>
Another interesting aspect is the <code>like</code> operator.  Imagine this as a regular expression-ish pattern matcher.  Lets say we wanted to find all students whose name begins with S. 
<br /><code>select * from students s where s.fname like 'S%'</code><br />
Note: With the like operator, % is treated as a wildcard.
