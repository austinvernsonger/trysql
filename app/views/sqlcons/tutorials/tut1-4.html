Wonderful! Our database will only return the row where the specified column = the specified value. If that row does not exist, then it will return no rows.  Another intresting aspect is the 'like' operator.  Imagine this a regular expression-ish pattern matcher.  Lets say we wanted to find all students whose name begins with T. 
<br />
<code>"select * from students where fname like 'S%'"</code>
