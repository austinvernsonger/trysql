<h3> Ch2-1: The Join</h3>
<p>
Now that you're more comfortable with the select statement, let's move on to joins.  Joins involve linking 2 or more tables together by a common column.  
For us, our "course_fcts" table holds several ids which then are represented in other tables with the associated information.  Try the query below. 
<code> "select * from course_fcts a join students b on a.student_id = b.id " </code>
