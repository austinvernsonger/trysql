<h3>Ch4-4 : Max/Min</h3>
<p>
The final section of our tutorial involves the max/min functions. The syntax is identitcal, but as you might guess the result for each varies. Use this functions on a particular column to fetch the maximum/minimum value of that field.  
<br /><code>select max(id) from course_fcts</code>
<br / > 
Note: To increase complexity, add a where clause limit which rows you search for max/min in.
