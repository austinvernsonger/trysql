<h3> Ch1-3: Where = </h3>
<p>
Great! Now see how we limited that dataset to only a few rows? Lets narrow the search down even more. Try fetching a single row from courses using the where clause.
<br /><code>select * from courses c where c.cnum = 224</code><br />
Using an = operator in a where clause is a good way to limit based on a very specific criteria.
