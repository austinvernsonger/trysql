<h3>Ch4-2 : Count (cont.)</h3>
<p>
To further assist in data analysis, we can employ the <code>group by<code> clause. 
<br /> <br />
This addition allows us to "group" aggregate function results together based on values in a column. 
<br /><code>select count(*) from students</code>
<br /><code>select count(*) from students where fname like 'S%'</code>
